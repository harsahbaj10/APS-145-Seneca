Variables 

1.Student 1 = A 

2.Student 2 = B  

3.Number of baskets by A = x 

4.Number of baskets by B = y 

5.Prize money = w 

6.Number of ties = T 

 

Start  

1.A and B challenge each other to the shoot-out. 

2.A simulated die is rolled once by A and B each. 

3.Die rolling (outcome). 

a) If A>B then A goes to Step.4. 

b) If B>A then B goes to Step.4. 

c) If A=B then repeat Step.2 until a winner is declared. 

4. The winner of Step.3 throws the ball 4 times. 

5. The second player throws the ball 4 times. 

6. Scenario i) ii) iii) 

i) x>y = A wins. (Go to Step.7) 

ii) y>x = B wins. (Go to Step.7) 

iii) x=y = tie (T) (Repeat step.4) 

7.  Determine prize money  

a) If Scenario i) x-y = w  

b) If Scenario ii) y-x = w 

c) if Scenario iii) T * 0.5 and then w - 

8. Gives prize money  

A) If scenario i) happens B gives money to A. 

B) If scenario ii) happens A gives money to B.
